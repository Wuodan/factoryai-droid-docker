# 🧠 Task: Modify ".gitignore" Generated by "droid-docker"

## 🎯 Goal

Ensure the "droid-docker" helper writes a ".gitignore" file that includes the
new comment "# Contains access token" followed by the path
".factory/auth.json". Keep the order consistent with the existing sensitive
entries managed by the script.

```text
# Contains access token
.factory/auth.json
```

## 🪜 Steps to Follow

### 📋 Plan and Review

Inspect how the script currently generates the ".gitignore" file. Design a
maintainable way to add the new entry, consider whether idempotency should be
addressed, and present the proposed implementation plan for approval before
making code changes.

### ⚙️ Implement and Test Incrementally

Apply the code update, adjust or create tests and documentation where needed,
run the relevant tests after each change, and execute the full test suite once
the modifications appear stable.

### 🧹 Code Quality and Linting

Determine suitable linters or formatters for every file you modify. Share the
proposed tooling configuration for approval, apply formatting or linting, and
resolve any reported issues.

### ✅ Final Review

Summarize the code updates, report test and lint results, and wait for explicit
approval before considering the task complete.
